        <p>The crabeater seal is one of the four species of true seals native to Antarctica. They are the most abundant species of seals in the world. Contrary to their name, crabeater seals do not eat crabs. They have unique weirdly shaped teeth that they use like a sieve to eat Antarctic krill. The name originates from the fact that people used to believe that they fed on a more varied range of crustaceans, including crabs.</p>

        <p>Crabeater seals are known for being very gregarious and congregating in large groups. They have a unique method of land locomotion where they sort of slither back and forth. This enables them to move surprisingly quickly in short bursts.</p>
